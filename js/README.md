css3-mediaqueries-js
--

css3-mediaqueries.js is a JavaScript library that makes CSS3 media queries work in all browsers.

**Browser support:** IE 5+, Firefox 1+ and Safari 2. Firefox 3.5+, Opera 7+, Safari 3+ and Chrome already offer native support for CSS3 media queries.

Installation
--

Include a link to the script somewhere on the page (whether in the `<head>` or before `</body>`)

    <script src="/js/css3-mediaqueries.min.js"></script>

And that's it! Keep in mind that the script will not detect media attributes on `<link>` elements, so it is recommended to use the ``@media`` property within the stylesheets themselves.
